# 2D-time-dependent-heat-equation-using-PINNs-tf2-
A Physics-Informed Neural Network to solve 2D time-dependent heat equations.


Inspired by [this](https://github.com/314arhaam/heat-pinn), Which solved a steady-state 2D heat equation using a Physics-Informed Neural Network. In this project, time is introduced.
